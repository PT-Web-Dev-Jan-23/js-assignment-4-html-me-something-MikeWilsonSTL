               <h3>Music</h3>

               <p>Might as well get the biggest one out of the way. 
                  I'm a professional musician who specializes in acoustic fingerstyle guitar. 
                  Over the years, however, I've ended up playing in nearly every major western genre. 
                  These days I play guitar in the hip-hop scene and I am constantly inspired by the talent I find myself surrounded with. </p>

            <p class="funParagraph" id="testP">Before music became my primary focus I thought about pursuing magic profesionally long term. 
               I've done magic since I was about 8 years old and for a year or so I did it full-time.
               I specialized in street magic and improvisational magic. You wouldn't find me on stage but you'd find me at a bar.
               These days I don't practice magic like I used to but I still have more than a few tricks up my sleeve. </p>

            <figcaption id="copyright">Copyright &copy; 2014 Alec Lofquist</figcaption>
            <p>I am a huge retro game/emulation nerd. You name it, I've tried it.
               I love the challenge of configuring settings, scraping metadata, and designing themes to create awesome UI/UX experiences.
               I also love the challenge of getting the emulators to run in ways they were designed but also in ways that they weren't.
               One of the things I plan to do in the future is to find a meaningful way to contribute to my favorite open-source emulators and emulator front-ends.</p>

            <h3>Parkour/Tumbling</h3>
            <img class="img" title="Me doing a backflip" src="./images/flip.gif" alt="Me doing a backflip">
            <p>I started training parkour in February of 2012 and it led me to somehow spending the next 4 years travelling across the country on a shoestring budget.
               Some of the best memories of my life were during this phase and it's a time I remember fondly.
               These days I throw a few flips when I can, but I'm more focused on developing my careers in coding and music.</p>

            <p>Making food and drink is probably one of my favorite ways to show appreciation for the people who matter to me.
               I normally go for time-consuming projects like dry-aging steaks at home and infusing whiskeys and vodkas because I also love saving money and these things are way cheaper when you do them yourself.</p>
